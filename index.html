                <p>Coming from a creative and technical background, I have a unique perspective that sets me apart. <br>
                I am more well suited for creative problem solving because I just am, duh. <br>
                Creativity helps me stay curios becuase I know that there are many wasy to do something, and looking at problem differently<br>
                is the same as looking at them creatively. <br>
                Skills like perserverance and critical thinking blend well with creativity and multiple perspectives. <br></p>
